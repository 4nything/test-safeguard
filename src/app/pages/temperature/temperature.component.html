        <a href="https://openweathermap.org/current" target="_blank">openweathermap.org free weather api</a>

        <li>The temperature should be displayed on the right side of the header, near the github logo.</li>
        <li>The temperature should be updated every 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>The temperature should be rounded to the nearest degree.</li>
        <li>The temperature should be displayed with the degree ยบ symbol.</li>
    </ul>
